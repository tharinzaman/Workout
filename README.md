This application allows the user to partake in a 7 minute workout, see a record of their past workouts, and calculate their BMI.
It is modularised using a layered-feature approach, where modules are created based on specific features and then internally
divided into submodules for their data, domain and presentation layers. The application utilises local notifications to remind the
user to partake in their daily workout. It also utilises SwiftData to display a record of the user's past workouts.
